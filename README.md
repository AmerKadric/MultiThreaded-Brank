I have developed a sophisticated multi-threaded banking application in C, featuring comprehensive data structures and functions for account creation, transaction handling, balance checking, and history tracking. The program intelligently processes data from CSV files, providing seamless record-keeping. Employing a professional and modular approach, the application's user interface is designed for optimal user experience, offering a range of banking operations. The inclusion of separate threads for interest calculation enhances financial functionality. A GitHub readme complements the project, offering detailed insights into its purpose, functionalities, and usage. The code prioritizes efficiency, synchronization, and user interaction, presenting a robust and professional solution for managing financial transactions and accounts.
